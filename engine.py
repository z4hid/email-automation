"""
Email Automation Engine using DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python)

This module provides an AI-powered email processing system that:
1. Classifies incoming emails into business categories
2. Generates professional draft replies automatically
3. Uses Google's Gemini AI model through DSPy framework

Main Components:
- EmailClassifierSignature: Defines how to classify emails
- EmailReplySignature: Defines how to generate replies  
- EmailProcessor: The main DSPy module that combines classification + reply generation
- EmailEngine: High-level interface for the entire system

DSPy Framework Benefits:
- Declarative programming instead of manual prompt engineering
- Automatic optimization of prompts and examples
- Better reliability than traditional prompt-based approaches
- Built-in few-shot learning capabilities
